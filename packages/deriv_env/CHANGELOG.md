- **Deprecation:** The `load` method is deprecated; it is recommended to use the new `initialize` method for improved flexibility. The `load` method will still function but may be removed in future releases.
- Introduced a new method `initialize` to handle initialization without requiring an env file directly.
- Improved package flexibility by removing the strict dependency on an env file for test environments.
